# Advent of Code 2022

Here are my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2022] puzzles.

Assuming the file `session.txt` contains a login cookie in a format
accepted by `curl --cookie`, or the file `day01/input.txt` already
contains your specific puzzle input for day 1, you can get the
corresponding output by running the command:
```sh
make day01/output.txt
```
