# Advent of Code 2022

Here are my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2022] puzzles.

Assuming that either:
* the file `session.txt` contains a login cookie in a format accepted
  by `curl --cookie`, or
* the file `day01/input.txt` already contains your specific puzzle
  input for day 1,
you can get the corresponding outputs by running the command:
```sh
make day01/output1.txt day01/output2.txt
```

You can also test the examples from the puzzle statement with:
```sh
python3 -m doctest day01/solve.py
```
